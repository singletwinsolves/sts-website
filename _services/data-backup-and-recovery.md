Having a robust and timely backup and recovery strategy is critical to the long term success of a business because it ensures your data and day-to-day operating procedures can be restored seamlessly in the event of data loss or corruption.



# Data Backup & Recovery

Unexpected data loss events can be caused by a variety of factors, such as hardware failure, software bugs, natural disasters, human error, or a cyber attack. A good backup and recovery strategy can help minimize the impact of such events and ensure that critical information can be quickly restored, minimizing downtime, potential loss of revenue, productivity and damage to your reputation.
