LET US TAKE CARE OF YOUR LINUX SERVERS
Our TLC Proactive Services program is a cost-effective way to manage your Linux infrastructure without having to hire a full-time Linux staff. Linux systems often are critical to your business systems and are needed to perform your most important functions. However, in many organizations, these also often get the least amount of attention for maintenance and monitoring.

With The Crafty Penguins Way, we will help you identify the potential blindsides in your current maintenance and disaster recovery approach to these systems. With our vast knowledge and experience with these systems and the applications that run on them, you can rest assured we have you covered. With 24/7 monitoring, management, and full access to our support team, you can stop worrying about your Linux systems.
